About Me
------------------------
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Department of Probability and Statistics, [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Cheng Zhang.
Previously, I received my bachelor degree in statistics from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University and my second bachelor degree in economics from National School of Development, Peking University.

Research Interests
------------------------
I am broadly interested in the theory and application of statistical machine learning. Specifically, my current research focus is Bayesian inference as well as its applications in the following topics:
- <strong>Bayesian Inference Methodology</strong>: innovative methods in variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, particle-based sampling, etc.
- <strong>Generative Models</strong>: score-based diffusion models, flow-based generative models, etc., and their connections with Bayesian inference.
- <strong>Computational Biology</strong>: Bayesian phylogenetic inference with deep learning methods. This is also my Ph.D. thesis.
